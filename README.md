# Java Stock Prices Client [![JetBrains team project](http://jb.gg/badges/team.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)

This project contains two modules:

 - A Java client that connects via REST & RSocket to a Kotlin service which streams a randomly generated set of prices. 
 - A JavaFX user interface that displays the updating prices in real time on a line chart.
 
This project is based on the demo at [SpringOne Platform 2019](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/10/fully-reactive-spring-kotlin-and-javafx-playing-together/), which was an update of an application demonstrated by [Josh Long](https://github.com/joshlong) and Trisha Gee at Code One 2018.

This specific code is an [IntelliJ IDEA tutorial](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/12/tutorial-reactive-spring-boot/) showing how to build Reactive applications with Kotlin, Spring, Java and JavaFX.
